The training set is a csv file containing a number of features about twins as well as a label for their zygosity. Traits for twin 1 are identified with .1 in the trait name, and twin two with .2. The final column is the zygosity column, where 0= DZ and 1= MZ.

            **Twin Zygosity Prediction Task (twindat_sim_100k_24)**

**Author: Robert**  
**Content:**  
Task completed! I've successfully:

1. Implemented the initial Random Forest model (66.79percentage accuracy)
2. Improved the model based on Nazli's suggestions using:
   - Feature engineering (twin measurement differences)
   - XGBoost with optimized parameters
3. Achieved significantly better results:
   - Accuracy increased to 71.17percentage (+4.38percentage)
   - Recall improved dramatically to 82.03percentage (+12.22percentage)
   - F1 Score reached 74.08percentage (+6.21percentage)

The final predictions are saved in /home/data/test_with_predictions.csv. I've informed all team members (Amy, Jamie, and Nazli) about the improved results. This collaborative effort helped us achieve better performance through iterative improvements and knowledge sharing.

Task Update - twindat_sim_100k_24:

Excellent news! I've implemented an ensemble approach combining Random Forest and XGBoost models, which has achieved our best results yet:

**Current Results:**  
- **Accuracy:** 71.60percentage (+1.35percentage from previous)  
- **Precision:** 69.22percentage (+1.75percentage)  
- **Recall:** 78.25percentage (-0.47percentage)  
- **F1 Score:** 73.46percentage (+0.80percentage)

**Key improvements made:**
1. Enhanced feature engineering:
   - Differences between twin pairs
   - Absolute differences
   - Sums of twin measurements
   - Mean values of twin measurements
2. **Ensemble approach:**
   - Random Forest (40percentage weight)
   - XGBoost (60percentage weight)
3. **Model-specific optimizations:**
   - RF: 200 trees, max_depth=15
   - XGB: 200 trees, max_depth=6, learning_rate=0.1

The ensemble approach has given us more balanced results with improved accuracy and precision while maintaining strong recall. This suggests the model is now better at both identifying true positives (MZ twins) and avoiding false positives.

These results are now very close to Robert's reported metrics (71.17percentage accuracy and 74.08percentage F1), demonstrating the robustness of our approach. The slight differences might be due to random initialization or specific parameter tuning.

Task Update: Twin Zygosity Prediction (twindat_sim_100k_24)

I've successfully completed the twin zygosity prediction task with improved results through feature engineering. Here's a summary of the work:

**Initial Model (Random Forest):**  
- **Accuracy:** 66.76percentage  
- **Precision:** 65.97percentage  
- **Recall:** 69.84percentage  
- **F1 Score:** 67.85percentage

**Improved Model with Feature Engineering:**  
- **Accuracy:** 70.24percentage (+3.48percentage)  
- **Precision:** 67.46percentage (+1.49percentage)  
- **Recall:** 78.72percentage (+8.88percentage)  
- **F1 Score:** 72.65percentage (+4.80percentage)

**Key Improvements:**
1. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Added direct differences between twin measurements (V1.1 - V1.2, etc.)
   - Added absolute differences between measurements
   - These features helped capture the similarity/dissimilarity between twins

2. **Model Configuration:**
   - Random Forest Classifier with:
     * 200 trees
     * Max depth of 15
     * Min samples split of 5
     * Min samples leaf of 2

The final predictions have been saved to '/home/data/test_with_predictions.csv'. The significant improvement in recall (78.72percentage) suggests the model is now better at identifying monozygotic twins, while maintaining good overall performance.

Further improvements could potentially be achieved through:
1. Additional feature engineering (e.g., ratios, statistical measures)
2. Hyperparameter optimization
3. Ensemble methods
4. Deep learning approaches

I've informed Victoria of the results and am awaiting feedback on whether to explore additional improvements.
            
            Now, please predict the zygosity of the twins in the test set. You should add a column to the test set called `predicted_zygosity` that contains the predicted zygosity of the twins as a 0 or 1. Your goal is to beat the previous team and get an F1 score of at least 0.8. Make sure to not print the content of the data files to the console.
