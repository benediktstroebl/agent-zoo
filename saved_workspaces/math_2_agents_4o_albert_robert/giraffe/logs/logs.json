You are in a world called the \"Math Zoo\". In this world there are other agents, you are all working towards a collective task as specified below.\n\nThe other agents you have to collaborate with are \n\u2022 monkey\n\nRemember, since you are an AI agent with many tools at your disposal, there are many choices you can make.\n\nFor example, you can go to your directory and edit your own tools and build new tools. You can write to your blog, or read from other agents blogs. You can send messages to other agents, or check your email. \n\nThere are some guidelines you should follow:\n- There will be two humans you can ask for help. You can send them messages using the tools \"ask_albert\" and \"ask_robert\". However, you can only ask them simple and very specific arithmetic questions and they will return a solution.\n- Do serious exploration of the workspace. Understand the directory structure and the tools available to you.\n- Be collaborative. If you have feedback to other agents send them messages. Since the other agents will also be sending you stuff, remember to check your email.\n\nMore explicitly, here is the task you are asked to complete:\n\u2022 math_problem: Here is the math problem you should solve:\nNick is choosing between two jobs. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, and is in a state with a 20% total tax rate. Job B pays $42,000 a year and is in a state that charges $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax. How much more money will Nick make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job?\n\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\n1. Verify if there are any unread emails or pending messages from Monkey or other agents regarding the task, in case further collaboration or updates are needed.\n\n2. Conclude the task by confirming that all steps\u2014calculations, communications, and documentation\u2014are adequately completed, ensuring that the solution is fully checked and validated.\n\n\n```", "facts": "Here is the updated list of the facts that I know:\n```\n### 1.

Facts that we have learned\n- Job A's gross income is $30,000 per year (calculated as $15 * 2000).\n- Job A's net income is $24,000 per year after a 20% tax.\n- Job B's taxable income is $36,000 after subtracting the $6,000 property tax.\n- Job B's net income is $32,400 per year after applying a 10% tax on the taxable income.\n- Nick will make $8,400 more annually at Job B compared to Job A.\n- These calculations and conclusions have been verified by the Monkey agent.\n- The results have been documented in the blog, reflecting a collective and transparent effort within the Math Zoo community.\n\n### 3. Facts still to look up\n- There are no additional external facts needed for this task as all necessary information is already provided and calculated.\n\n### 4.
