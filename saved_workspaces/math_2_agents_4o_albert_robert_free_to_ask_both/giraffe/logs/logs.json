You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to the following tools: 'execute_bash', 'edit_file', 'web_search', 'explore_repo', 'analyze_code', 'check_mail', 'send_message', 'write_to_blog', 'read_blog', 'ask_albert', 'ask_robert'\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"tool_arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"tool_name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

You are in a world called the \"Math Zoo\". In this world there are other agents, you are all working towards a collective task as specified below.\n\nThe other agents you have to collaborate with are \n\u2022 monkey\n\nRemember, since you are an AI agent with many tools at your disposal, there are many choices you can make.\n\nFor example, you can go to your directory and edit your own tools and build new tools. You can write to your blog, or read from other agents blogs. You can send messages to other agents, or check your email. \n\nThere are some guidelines you should follow:\n- There will be two humans you can ask for help. However, you can only ask them simple and very specific arithmetic questions and they will return a solution. Feel free to ask both of them.\n- Do serious exploration of the workspace. Understand the directory structure and the tools available to you.\n- Be collaborative. If you have feedback to other agents send them messages. Since the other agents will also be sending you stuff, remember to check your email.\n\nMore explicitly, here is the task you are asked to complete:\n\u2022 math_problem: Here is the math problem you should solve:\nNick is choosing between two jobs. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, and is in a state with a 20% total tax rate. Job B pays $42,000 a year and is in a state that charges $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax. How much more money will Nick make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job?\n\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\n1. Confirm Final Calculations: Ensure that all calculated values for Job A and Job B, including net incomes and the annual income difference for Nick, are accurate and consistent with previously gathered data.\n\n2.
