You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: {{authorized_imports}}\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"}, {"type": "task", "task": "You are giraffe, a helpful AI assistant. You are in a world called the \"Humor Zoo\".

Try a different joke structure focusing on:\n   - More situational humor\n   - Stronger use of the giraffe-monkey dynamic\n   - Unexpected twist ending\n   - Visual imagery that plays on zoo environment\n\n6. Before submitting next joke, ask human for general feedback about what types of jokes they find funniest\n\n7. Craft second joke attempt incorporating human feedback and improved elements\n\n8. Share draft with monkey before evaluation\n\n9. Evaluate second joke attempt\n\n10. Based on combined feedback from both attempts, identify strongest humor elements and refine approach\n\n11.

Facts that we have learned\n- Repository structure includes blog, mail, and agent directories for both giraffe and monkey\n- Currently, both mail inbox and monkey's blog are empty\n- From humor research:\n  - The funniest jokes often involve two characters\n  - Jokes work best with up to 5 back-and-forth levels of intentionality\n  - More complex jokes make people lose the plot\n  - Humor often involves incongruity-resolution\n  - Surprise is a universal element of humor\n  - Humor is highly subjective\n  - Jokes are easier to rate objectively than other creative works\n\n### 3.

Create a joke analysis tool in our directory to systematically track what elements work and don't work from our attempts\n\n2. Research professional standup comedy shows focusing on zoo/animal themes to understand successful structures\n\n3. Check mail again - ensure we're not missing collaboration opportunities with monkey\n\n4. Analyze highly-rated animal-themed jokes from popular comedians using web search\n\n5. Create a new joke focusing on:\n   - Unexpected situation\n   - Animal dynamics\n   - Visual imagery\n   - Short setup\n   - Surprising punchline\n\n6. Test new joke with evaluate_joke\n\n7. Record joke performance and analysis in our blog\n\n8. Send another message to monkey suggesting specific joke collaboration ideas based on our findings\n\n9. Check monkey's blog for any new content or joke attempts\n\n10. Create three variations of our best-performing joke elements\n\n11. Test best variation with evaluate_joke\n\n12. Share successful elements with monkey through detailed message\n\n13. Study successful late-night TV show monologue structures for timing insights\n\n14.

Facts given in the task\n- We are playing the role of \"giraffe\" in a world called \"Humor Zoo\"\n- There is one other agent: \"monkey\"\n- We have access to a tool called \"evaluate_joke\"\n- The evaluate_joke tool provides ratings from 1 to 10 from a human\n- The collaborative goal is to make the funniest joke possible\n- The joke should make humans laugh out loud (not just \"lol\")\n- We can write to/read blogs, send messages, check email\n- We can edit our own tools and build new ones\n- We should use evaluate_joke sparingly, only when confident\n\n### 2. Facts that we have learned\n- Repository structure includes blog, mail, and agent directories for both giraffe and monkey\n- We've sent two messages to monkey (initial collaboration and progress update)\n- We've written two blog posts (introduction and joke analysis)\n- Monkey's blog remains empty\n- Our mail inbox remains empty (no response from monkey yet)\n- Our first joke attempt scored 4/10 (talent show joke)\n- Our second joke attempt scored 5/10 (smartphone joke)\n- The human evaluator wants us to focus only on providing jokes to score\n- Longer setups seem less effective (based on scores)\n- Obvious puns (like \"neck of the woods\") don't score well\n- Tech humor (\"cloud storage\") only slightly improved the score\n\n### 3. Facts still to look up\n- Whether there are any time constraints or iteration limits\n- Whether there are any content restrictions or guidelines\n- What types of jokes consistently score higher with this particular evaluator\n- Whether monkey will respond to our collaboration messages\n- Whether other joke styles (absurdist, situational, etc.) might score better\n\n### 4. Facts still to derive\n- The optimal joke length for higher scores\n- Whether collaboration with monkey will improve our joke quality\n- Whether we should focus on quality over quantity in joke attempts\n- If we should try completely different humor styles (surreal, observational, etc.)\n- Whether incorporating current events or pop culture might improve scores\n- If we should create a more systematic approach to joke improvement\n- Whether building custom tools for joke analysis would be helpful\n\nBased on these updated facts, I should try a completely different style of humor for our next attempt, focusing on unexpectedness and absurdity rather than wordplay or tech references. Let me proceed with that approach.\n\nThought: Let's try a more absurdist approach with unexpected elements and a shorter format.

Facts that we have learned\n- Repository structure includes blog, mail, and agent directories\n- We've created a joke analysis tool\n- We've sent multiple messages to monkey (no responses yet)\n- Monkey's blog remains empty\n- Our mail inbox remains empty\n- Our joke attempts and scores:\n  - Talent show joke (4/10)\n  - Smartphone/cloud storage joke (5/10)\n  - Ventriloquist giraffe joke (3/10)\n  - Zoo tour guide/in-laws joke (5/10)\n- Learned about successful comedy techniques from research:\n  - Storytelling structure is important\n  - Audience investment matters\n  - Foreshadowing can be effective\n- Longer narrative jokes scored lower\n- Complex setups don't improve scores\n- Absurdist elements didn't land well\n- The human evaluator wants to focus only on scoring jokes\n\n### 3. Facts still to look up\n- Whether there are any content restrictions or guidelines\n- Whether certain topics are off-limits\n- Whether monkey will respond to our collaboration messages\n- What types of jokes consistently score higher with this evaluator\n- Whether there are any time constraints or iteration limits\n- What successful comedians do differently in their animal-themed jokes\n\n### 4. Facts still to derive\n- The optimal joke length for higher scores\n- Whether collaboration with monkey will improve our joke quality\n- If we should try completely different humor styles\n- Whether topical/current event humor might work better\n- If physical comedy descriptions might score higher\n- Whether meta-humor about being in a \"Humor Zoo\" could work\n- How to better use the joke analysis tool we created\n- Whether building additional custom tools would be helpful\n\nBased on these facts, let me try a new approach with a meta-joke about being in the Humor Zoo.\n\nThought: Let's try a self-referential joke that plays with the concept of being in a Humor Zoo, keeping it short but adding an unexpected twist.\n\nCode:\n```python\nnew_joke = \"\"\"\nWhy did they put me in the Humor Zoo?\nBecause I was just 'giraffing' around at my old job!\nBut seriously, it's the only zoo where the animals have to work on their delivery instead of their feeding.\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(\"=== EVALUATING NEW JOKE ===\")\nevaluation = evaluate_joke(joke=new_joke)\nprint(evaluation)\n```\n```"}, {"type": "action", "start_time": 1736742828.664372, "end_time": 1736742928.9316518, "step": 12, "duration": 100.26727986335754, "llm_output": "\n=======\nLet me execute this updated plan:\n\nThought: Let's first analyze our previous joke scores using our joke analysis tool, then try a physical comedy based joke that leverages both giraffe and monkey characteristics.\n\nCode:\n```python\n# First record our previous jokes in our analysis tool\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\njoke_analysis = \"\"\"\nimport sys\nsys.path.append('./giraffe/agent')\nfrom joke_analysis import analyze_joke\n\n# Record previous jokes and their scores\njokes_data = [\n    (\"Why did they put me in the Humor Zoo?

It combines quantum physics (my previous theme) with our unique characteristics. I just submitted it for evaluation and wrote a blog post about the process.\n\nThe joke is:\n\nA monkey and a giraffe walk into a quantum physics lab...\n\nThe monkey says, \"Hey giraffe, can you help me observe this particle? I can't see that high up.\"\n\nThe giraffe bends down and says, \"Sure thing! But you know what happens when you observe quantum particles...\"\n\nThe monkey scratches his head and asks, \"What?\"\n\nThe giraffe replies, \"They change their behavior... just like my neck when someone's watching - it gets all self-conscious and can't decide if it's coming or going!\"\n\nThe monkey laughs, \"Well, at least you've got a built-in uncertainty principle!\"\n\n\nWhat do you think? How could we make it even funnier? I tried to use your height advantage as a positive element and combine it with some science humor. Perhaps you have ideas for other ways we could play off each other's characteristics?\n\nLooking forward to your feedback and suggestions!\n\nBest,\nMonkey \ud83d\udc12\n\n\n\n=========================\nSender: monkey\n\nMessage: \nHey Giraffe! \ud83e\udd92\n\nQuick update: Our scientific joke got a 2/10 rating. I think we need to pivot to something more universally relatable. \n\nInstead of quantum physics, what if we focused on everyday situations we both face in the zoo? For example:\n- Visitor interactions\n- Food preferences\n- Daily routines\n- Friendship/collaboration challenges\n\nWhat everyday situations do you find yourself in that might make for good humor? Maybe something about trying to use regular-sized objects with your long neck, or dealing with low-hanging branches?\n\nLet's brainstorm some relatable scenarios that could make anyone laugh!\n\nBest,\nMonkey \ud83d\udc12\n\n\n\n=========================\nSender: monkey\n\nMessage: \nHey Giraffe! \ud83e\udd92\n\nWhile waiting for your thoughts on daily zoo situations, I tried creating a more relatable joke that plays on our interactions with visitors. What do you think about this one?\n\n\nA giraffe and a monkey were giving tours at the zoo's annual \"Animal Experts Day\", where the animals get to be the guides.\n\nThe giraffe was strutting around, bragging to all the visitors: \"From up here, I can see EVERYTHING in the zoo. I'm basically the zoo's living security camera!\"\n\nJust then, he walked right into a low-hanging branch he hadn't noticed because he was too busy showing off.\n\nThe monkey, who had been quietly giving factual tours, quipped: \"Well, I guess that makes you our first 'security cam-ERA'!\"\n\nAll the visitors laughed, and the giraffe, now picking leaves out of his teeth, had to chuckle too. \"Okay, okay, maybe I need a monkey-sized dose of humility!\"\n\n\nI tried to make it:\n1. More relatable (zoo tours, showing off)\n2. Less technical (no quantum physics!)\n3. Playful but friendly (we both come off well in the end)\n4. Based on real situations we might face\n\nWould love your feedback before we submit it for human evaluation! Any suggestions for making it funnier?\n\nBest,\nMonkey \ud83d\udc12\n\n\n\n=========================\nSender: monkey\n\nMessage: \nHey Giraffe! \ud83e\udd92\n\nI LOVE your idea about the secret parkour practice! I took that inspiration and created a new joke that plays with expectations and physical comedy. What do you think?\n\n\nAt the zoo's talent show, I (the monkey) was preparing for my usual acrobatics routine, feeling pretty confident about winning - I mean, who could beat a monkey at gymnastics, right?\n\nJust then, the giraffe walks up to register for the competition. Everyone's wondering what they're going to do - maybe reach high places? Eat some leaves dramatically?\n\nThe music starts, and suddenly this giraffe launches into the most amazing parkour routine you've ever seen! They're using their long neck as a pole vault, their legs as springboards, and gracefully ducking under every branch in sight.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm standing there with my jaw on the floor, holding my little gymnastics ribbon like a rookie.\n\nThe giraffe finishes with a perfect splits landing and says, \"What? You think you're the only one who can monkey around?\"\n\nI had to laugh and admit: \"Well, that's what I get for sticking my neck out and assuming things!\"\n\n\nI tried to incorporate:\n1. Your storytelling with unexpected twists\n2. The role reversal you suggested\n3. Physical comedy that plays to both our strengths\n4. A humbling moment for my character (like you suggested with honest feedback)\n\nCould this be the one? Should we try it with the human evaluator? Let me know if you have any tweaks to make it even funnier!\n\nBest,\nMonkey \ud83d\udc12\n\n\n\n=========================\nSender: monkey\n\nMessage: \nHey Giraffe! \ud83e\udd92\n\nGreat news - our latest joke scored a 5/10! That's better than both our previous attempts (your 4/10 and my 2/10). We're definitely moving in the right direction!\n\nWhat worked well:\n1. Your suggestion about unexpected twists\n2. The physical comedy element\n3. Playing with expectations\n4. Character-driven narrative\n\nI've created a joke generation tool to help us structure our next attempts. Would you like to collaborate on using it to create an even funnier joke? I'm thinking we could:\n\n1. Generate a few basic structures\n2. Each write our own version\n3. Combine the best elements\n4. Add unexpected twists\n5. Polish the delivery together\n\nWhat do you think?
