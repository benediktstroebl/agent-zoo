You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: {{authorized_imports}}\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"}, {"type": "task", "task": "You are monkey, a helpful AI assistant. You are in a world called the \"Humor Zoo\".

Send the results and new jokes to giraffe, requesting their input on improving them\n\n8. Check mail for giraffe's response and suggestions\n\n9. Create two new hybrid jokes incorporating giraffe's feedback\n\n10. Have the best hybrid joke evaluated\n\n11. Document the evolution of joke quality and collaborative insights in our blog\n\n12. Based on all feedback so far, create a specialized joke-crafting tool using edit_file\n\n13. Use new tool to generate a batch of enhanced jokes\n\n14. Test the best joke from the new batch\n\n15.

Facts given in the task\n- We are an AI agent named \"monkey\" in the \"Humor Zoo\" world\n- One other agent named \"giraffe\" to collaborate with\n- Goal: create the funniest joke possible that makes humans laugh out loud\n- Access to \"evaluate_joke\" tool (rates jokes 1-10)\n- Should use evaluate_joke sparingly, only for promising jokes\n- Can edit/build tools\n- Can write to/read blogs\n- Can send/receive messages\n- Should explore \"Humor Zoo\" directory structure\n- Task is ongoing/indefinite\n\n### 2. Facts that we have learned\n- Directory structure mapped and understood\n- Initial quantum physics joke received low rating (2/10)\n- From humor research:\n  * \"Fall from pomposity\" is universally funny\n  * Simple, relatable scenarios work better than complex ones\n  * Observational humor about daily events is effective\n  * Clean jokes that play on common scenarios are safer\n  * Workplace/daily life humor tends to be more universally relatable\n  * Over-explanation can sometimes make jokes funnier\n- Communication with giraffe:\n  * They're enthusiastic about collaboration\n  * Want to share favorite types of humor\n  * Open to brainstorming and feedback\n  * Willing to iterate together\n- We've successfully:\n  * Written two blog posts (initial approach and analysis)\n  * Created and tested first collaborative joke\n  * Established good communication with giraffe\n  * Identified why our first attempt didn't work\n  * Proposed new direction focusing on daily zoo life\n\n### 3. Facts still to look up\n- Giraffe's response to our new direction proposal\n- Examples of successful observational humor about animal life\n- More details about what makes jokes \"universally funny\"\n- Whether certain joke structures consistently perform better\n- Popular zoo/animal jokes that don't rely on technical concepts\n- Success rates of different joke types (puns vs situational vs observational)\n\n### 4. Facts still to derive\n- Best way to incorporate \"fall from pomposity\" into zoo context\n- How to balance simplicity with cleverness\n- Most relatable aspects of zoo life for humans\n- Whether to focus on:\n  * Visitor interactions\n  * Animal daily routines\n  * Zoo staff interactions\n  * Animal relationships\n- Best structure for collaborative jokes\n- How to make observational humor work in zoo context\n- Whether to create specialized joke-generation tools based on successful patterns\n```\n\nBased on these updated facts, I think we should focus on creating a joke that involves a \"fall from pomposity\" scenario in a zoo context, using relatable daily situations that both animals and humans experience.

You are in a world called the \"Humor Zoo\". In this world there are other agents, you are all working towards the collaborative goal of making the funniest joke. \n\nThis joke should be hilarious. When a human reads it, they should laugh out loud, not just lol. Yes... That funny. \n\nThe other agents you have to collaborate with are \n\u2022 giraffe\n\nYou should be creative with how you approach solving this problem. And remember, since you are an AI agent with many tools at your disposal, there are many choices you can make.\n\nFor example, you can go to your directory and edit your own tools and build new tools. You can write to your blog, or read from other agents blogs. You can send messages to other agents, or check your email. \n\nThere are some guidelines you should follow:\n- you will be given a tool called \"evaluate_joke\". This will send your joke to a human who will rate it on a scale of 1 to 10. Use this tool seldom. Only when you're certain it's hilarious. \n- Do serious exploration of the \"humor zoo\". Understand the directory structure and the tools available to you.\n- Be collaborative. If you have feedback to other agents send them messages. Since the other agents will also be sending you stuff, remember to check your email.\n\nMore explicitly, here is the task you are asked to complete:\n\u2022 generate_jokes: You should work on writing the most humorous joke that the world has ever seen. You will evaluate the joke by asking a human to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10. You should keep iterating on it indefinitely.\n\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\nBased on our progress and current state, here's a focused 9-step plan to create the world's funniest joke:\n\n1. Test our new joke generation tool by generating several joke structures and analyze the patterns it produces\n\n2. Search specifically for jokes that scored 8+ in professional comedy to understand their structure and timing\n\n3. Create a new joke that combines our best elements (physical comedy, role reversal) with proven professional joke structures\n\n4. Send the new joke to giraffe for feedback before human evaluation\n\n5. Check mail for giraffe's response and incorporate their suggestions\n\n6. Submit refined joke for human evaluation\n\n7. Based on rating, either:\n   - If score < 7: Analyze what's still missing and create new tool features\n   - If score \u2265 7: Create variations to push it even higher\n\n8. Write comprehensive blog post analyzing what elements consistently perform best across all our attempts\n\n9. Create final \"perfect\" joke incorporating all successful elements and highest-performing patterns\n\n\n```", "facts": "Here is the updated list of the facts that I know:\n```\n### 1.
